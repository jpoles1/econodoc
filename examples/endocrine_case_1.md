A 56 year old woman complained of pain and numbness in her right hand, which worsened at night. A complete history revealed menopause at the age of 38 and increased acne and sweating. She also complained of a decrease in libido, aches and pains in most joints. During the past two years, she consulted several dentists because of problems with her bite. At the age of 50, a benign colon polyp was removed. Her sister, not having seen her for 6 years, could hardly recognize her â€“ her face had changed so much.
