# Case 3: Pricey Pill To Swallow

In June 2018, [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/medicare-spending-name-brand-drugs-rose-77-percent-over-five-n880096) that Medicare was spending 77% more money on name-brand pharmaceuticals as compared to five years ago, despite the fact that these medications were being purchased at lower rates. How could this be? The writer attributes this change to an increase in the prices of these medications, which is paradoxical given that many have generics available. This may represent a significant cost-burden on the Medicare system, preventing spending on other valuable interventions.

The article cites a [report from the Office of the Inspector General](https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-15-00080.pdf) suggesting that "brand-name insulin, cholesterol medication, and inhalers" were costing patients the most, particularly given that they are used to manage chronic health issues. Just how much more do these brand-name medications cost the Medicare system as compared to generics? We can find out using EconoMed.

Let's use Statins, a class of drugs used to inhibit the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme in order to treat hypercholesterolemia, as an example. A number of statins are avaible, many of which have humungous price differences between brand-name medications and their generic counterparts. Zocor, for instance, is a brand-name formulation of Simvastatin. How much more do you think Zocor costs Medicare compared to the generic?

You might be surprised to hear that the cost per dosage unit is around 42x more for Zocor, according to the [EconoMed price data](https://jpoles1.github.io/economed/?locale=MANHATTAN%2C%20NY&outpatient=&inpatient=&pharma=Simvastatin%2CZocor%20-%20Simvastatin). How about for atorvastatin calcium, commonly known by the brand-name Lipitor? Buying the brand name atorvasatatin will cost Medicare about 30x more per dosage unit according to [EconoMed](https://jpoles1.github.io/economed//?locale=MANHATTAN%2C%20NY&outpatient=&inpatient=&pharma=Lipitor%20-%20Atorvastatin%20Calcium%2CAtorvastatin%20Calcium). Altoprev, the brand-name formulation of lovastatin will cost a staggering 111x greater cost to Medicare compared to the generic dosage unit according to [EconoMed](https://jpoles1.github.io/economed/?locale=MANHATTAN%2C%20NY&outpatient=&inpatient=&pharma=Lovastatin%2CAltoprev%20-%20Lovastatin).

For healthcare providers, it's really important to understand the costs of the medications being provided to patients. Not every generic is equivalent to its brand-name counterpart, but being more conciencous, it can go a long way to help dramatically reduce the cost of medications faced by both insurers like Medicare, and patients.
