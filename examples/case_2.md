In June 2018, the [Houston Chronicle reported](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Cost-of-ER-visits-nearly-doubled-as-fees-are-12970203.php) that the cost of paying for the average individual's Emergency Room (ER) visits had nearly doubled from 2009 to 2016. For a large system like Medicare, tasked with insuring 56.8 million Americans in 2016 (according to the [NCPSSM](http://www.ncpssm.org/our-issues/medicare/medicare-fast-facts/)), this can place a trememndous cost-burden on the system. 

The Houston Chronicle cites [research by the Health Care Cost Institute](http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/healthy-bytes/) suggesting that this trend is a result of changes in the way ER visits were coded, rather than the overall number of visits. There are typically [five levels](http://www.medicalbillingcptmodifiers.com/2013/01/emergency-department-cpt-codes-99281.html) at which ER visits can be coded depending on their severity: 
    
    99281) ER visit w/ problem focused history; problem focused examination; and straightforward medical decision making.
    
    99282) ER visit w/ expanded problem focused history; expanded problem focused examination; and low complexity medical decision making.
    
    99283) ER visit w/ expanded problem focused history; expanded problem focused examination; and moderate complexity medical decision making.

    99284) ER visit w/ detailed problem focused history; detailed problem focused examination; and moderate complexity medical decision making.

    99285) ER visit w/ comprehensive problem focused history; comprehensive problem focused examination; and high complexity medical decision making.
