# EconoMed
EconoMed is a tool used to help US healthcare providers to understand the cost of the care they deliver using cost data from Medicare.
The tool was developed by by the NYU School of Medicine DCIM group.


## Rationale
When healthcare providers are caring for a patient, the costs of labs, procedures, and medications can add up. Get an idea for how much your care plan will cost to Medicare with the EconoMed tool.

## How to use

Navigate your web browser to https://jpoles1.github.io/economed/.

1) Input your management plan into the tool, and it will fetch the cost of the care from medicare fee schedule data.
2) Think! How do you perceive the balance between the quality of care and its cost? Consider if any of the testing is unecessary or ineffectual.
3) Copy your url and share it with others to show them your list of costs.<br>
For example, here's the <a href="https://jpoles1.github.io/economed/#Alanine%20amino%20(alt)%20(sgpt),Transferase%20(ast)%20(sgot),Assay%20of%20ggt,Assay%20alkaline%20phosphatase,Bilirubin%20total,Bilirubin%20direct,Prothrombin%20time,Assay%20of%20serum%20albumin" target="_blank">cost of each test in a hepatic function test panel</a>.
